## COF: Cardano Open Funding

**Building the Backbone for Sustainable Open-Source Funding on Cardano**


## Who We Are

COF (Cardano Open Funding) is a pioneering initiative dedicated to making open-source development on Cardano **sustainable, resilient, and transparent**.  
Our mission: empower builders to focus on innovation, not fundraising—so Cardano can scale securely and efficiently.

## What We Do

COF is building an automated, data-driven platform to:

- **Map project dependencies** using advanced AI models, starting with major Cardano projects and expanding across the ecosystem.
- **Automate and transparently split funding** to the most critical dependencies, ensuring even the smallest but most vital libraries receive support.
- **Provide a public dashboard** to show exactly where funding goes, how healthy each project is, and the impact of community support.

## How You Can Get Involved

- **Feedback:**  
  Share your thoughts—what works, what doesn’t, and what’s missing.

- **Pilot Participation:**  
  Partner with us to map and fund dependencies for your projects.

- **Letters of Support:**  
  If you believe in our vision, a letter of support for our Catalyst proposal helps drive this initiative forward.

- **Workshops & AMAs:**  
  Co-host sessions with us to introduce COF to the Cardano community and gather feedback from real builders.
